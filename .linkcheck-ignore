# Known Broken Links - Documentation Only

## Purpose
This file documents known broken links in the documentation that are:
1. Expected/intentional (test files, brainstorm references)
2. External references outside the docs/ directory
3. Planned for future implementation

## Usage

This file is parsed by `/craft:docs:check-links` to distinguish between:
- **Critical broken links** (not in this file) → Exit code 1, blocks CI
- **Expected broken links** (documented here) → Exit code 0, shown as warnings

### Format

```markdown
### Category Name
File: `path/to/file.md`
Target: `path/to/target.md`
- Purpose: Why this link is expected to be broken

### Multiple Files/Targets
Files with broken links:
- `path/to/file1.md`
- `path/to/file2.md`

Targets: `target/pattern/*.md`
```

### Pattern Support
- **Exact paths**: `File: docs/test.md` matches exactly
- **Glob patterns**: `Files: docs/specs/*.md` matches all spec files
- **Any target**: Omit `Target:` line to ignore all broken links in file
- **Path normalization**: `docs/path` and `../path` are equivalent

## Categories

### 1. Test Violation Files (Intentional)
File: `docs/test-violations.md`
- Purpose: Test data for `craft:docs:check-links` and `craft:docs:lint`
- Contains intentionally broken links to verify linting works
- Should NOT be fixed

### 2. Brainstorm References (Gitignored)
Files with broken links:
- `docs/specs/SPEC-craft-hub-v2-2026-01-15.md`
- `docs/specs/SPEC-teaching-workflow-2026-01-16.md`

Targets: `docs/brainstorm/*.md` (gitignored, not published to website)
- Brainstorm files are working documents, not published
- Links are for local development reference only
- Fix: Update specs to reference GitHub blob URLs or remove references

### 3. README References (Outside Docs)
Files with broken links:
- `docs/TEACHING-DOCS-INDEX.md`

Target: `../README.md` (repository root, not in docs/)
- README.md is not published to documentation site
- Fix: Copy relevant content to docs/ or link to GitHub

### 4. Individual Command Pages (Not Implemented)
Files with broken links:
- `docs/TEACHING-DOCS-INDEX.md`
- `docs/teaching-migration.md`

Targets:
- `../commands/site/publish.md`
- `../commands/site/progress.md`
- `../commands/site/validate.md`
- `../commands/site/build.md`
- `../commands/site/create.md`
- `../commands/site/deploy.md`
- `../commands/site/check.md`
- `../commands/git/worktree.md`
- `../commands/git/branch.md`
- `../commands/git/sync.md`

Reason: Commands are documented in category files (e.g., `commands/site.md`, `commands/git.md`), not individual pages
Fix: Update links to point to category pages with anchors (e.g., `commands/site.md#publish`)

### 5. Manual Testing Checklist (Outside Docs)
File: `docs/guide/teaching-workflow.md`
Target: `../../tests/MANUAL-TESTING-CHECKLIST.md`

Reason: Test files are not published to documentation site
Fix: Remove reference or copy checklist to docs/

### 6. Command Documentation Examples
Files with broken links:
- `commands/docs/check-links.md` (contains intentional example broken links)
- `docs/git-init-docs-index.md` (reference to help/hub.md as example)

Targets: `../other.md`, `file.md`, `help/hub.md`
Reason: These are intentional example links shown in documentation to illustrate what broken links look like
Fix: Not needed - examples are correct as-is

## Build Status
- **Build command**: `mkdocs build --strict` will show these warnings
- **Expected**: ~30 warnings from categories above
- **Action required**: Fix categories #3, #4, #5 in future PRs
- **No action needed**: Categories #1, #2 (intentional)

## Next Steps (Phase 2+)
1. Update teaching docs to use category page anchors
2. Copy README teaching section to docs/ or use GitHub links
3. Consider removing brainstorm references from specs (or use GitHub URLs)
4. Decide: Keep test-violations.md or move to tests/
