# Git Clean - Remove merged branches

This command safely removes branches that have been merged.

## What I'll do

1. **Analyze merged branches** - Identify branches that have been merged
2. **Check for issues** - Detect uncommitted changes or other blockers
3. **Preview or execute** - Show what will be deleted (dry-run) or delete branches
4. **Confirm deletion** - Ask before deleting (unless --dry-run)

## Safety

- Never deletes current branch
- Never deletes protected branches (main/master/dev/develop)
- Skips branches with uncommitted changes
- Always confirms before deletion
- Supports `--dry-run` to preview without executing

## Usage

```bash
# Preview what would be deleted
/craft:git:clean --dry-run
/craft:git:clean -n

# Actually delete merged branches (with confirmation)
/craft:git:clean
```

## Implementation

The command:
1. Lists all local branches using `git branch --merged`
2. Filters out protected branches and current branch
3. Checks each branch for uncommitted changes
4. In dry-run mode: Displays preview with warnings
5. In normal mode: Asks for confirmation, then deletes branches
