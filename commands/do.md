**Note**: Dry-run shows routing decision based on complexity score. Agent delegation triggers for medium (4-7) and complex (8-10) tasks.

## Branch-Aware Routing (NEW in v2.16.0)

Before routing, check branch protection status. When on `dev` or `main` and the task involves code changes:

### On `dev` (block-new-code)

If task involves creating new files or writing code:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "You're on dev (protected). How should I handle this code task?",
    "header": "Branch",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "Create worktree (Recommended)",
        "description": "Auto-create feature branch and worktree from task description."
      },
      {
        "label": "Write spec only",
        "description": "Create a spec file on dev (allowed) without code changes."
      },
      {
        "label": "Analyze only",
        "description": "Read and analyze code without making edits."
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### On `main` (block-all)

```
Cannot route code tasks on main. All changes go through PRs.

Switch to dev: git checkout dev
Then retry: /craft:do <task>
```

### On `feature/*`

Route directly without branch intervention — no restrictions.

## How It Works

1. **Check Branch** - Verify branch protection status (NEW in v2.16.0)
2. **Check Spec** - Look for existing spec matching task (NEW in v1.1.0)
3. **Analyze** - Parse task description for intent and category
4. **Score Complexity** - Calculate 0-10 score based on 5 factors (NEW in v1.23.0)
5. **Route Decision** - Choose execution strategy:
   - **Score 0-3**: Route to craft commands (traditional)
   - **Score 4-7**: Delegate to specialized agent (NEW)
   - **Score 8-10**: Delegate to orchestrator-v2 (NEW)
   - **Skill match**: Direct skill invocation for guard:audit, insights:apply
5. **Execute** - Run commands or invoke agent with forked context
6. **Synthesize** - Gather results and report to user
7. **Report** - Summarize what was done

## Agent Delegation Workflow (NEW in v1.23.0)

When complexity score ≥ 4, `/craft:do` delegates to specialized agents:

### Step 1: Complexity Analysis

```
User: /craft:do "add OAuth login to the app"

Claude analyzes:
- Multi-step task: +2 (design → implement → test)
- Requires planning: +2 (auth architecture)
- Total score: 4/10 (Medium)
→ Decision: Delegate to feature-dev agent
```

### Step 2: Agent Selection

Based on task keywords and complexity:

```
Keywords: "add", "OAuth", "login"
Category: Feature Development
Score: 4/10
→ Selected agent: feature-dev (max complexity: 7)
```

### Step 3: Forked Context Execution

```
Main Context (your conversation)
    ↓
    Spawn feature-dev agent in forked context
    ↓
    Agent works independently:
    - Designs OAuth flow
    - Creates implementation plan
    - Generates test stubs
    - Identifies dependencies
    ↓
    Results synthesized back to main context
```

### Step 4: Result Synthesis

```
Claude receives agent results and presents:
✓ Architecture designed (OAuth 2.0 + PKCE)
✓ Implementation plan created (4 phases)
✓ Test stubs generated (12 test cases)
✓ Dependencies identified (oauth2 SDK, JWT library)

Ready to implement? (y/n)
```

## Agent Delegation Rules

### When to Delegate

| Condition             | Action                   | Reason                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Score < 4             | Route to commands        | Simple, fast execution             |
| Score 4-7             | Delegate to agent        | Medium complexity, needs expertise |
| Score 8-10            | Delegate to orchestrator | Complex, multi-agent coordination  |
| User says "no agents" | Force command routing    | Explicit user preference           |

### Forked Context Benefits

- **Isolation**: Agent failures don't corrupt main conversation
- **Parallelization**: Multiple agents can run simultaneously
- **Resource Control**: Each agent has own context budget
- **Clean Results**: Only final synthesis appears in main conversation

### Fallback Strategy

If agent delegation fails or is denied:

```
1. Attempt agent delegation
   ↓ (if permission denied or agent fails)
2. Fall back to command routing
   ↓
3. Execute traditional command sequence
   ↓
4. Report with note: "Completed without agent delegation"
```

## Complexity Analysis (NEW in v1.23.0)

Before routing, `/craft:do` analyzes task complexity to determine execution strategy:

### Complexity Scoring

| Score | Task Type   | Routing Decision           | Example                |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 0-3   | **Simple**  | Route to commands          | "lint the code"        |
| 4-7   | **Medium**  | Single agent delegation    | "add OAuth login"      |
| 8-10  | **Complex** | orchestrator-v2 delegation | "prepare v2.0 release" |

### Scoring Factors

Each factor adds +2 to complexity score:

- **Multi-step task** - Requires 3+ distinct operations
  - Example: "add auth" → design + implement + test
- **Cross-category task** - Spans multiple categories
  - Example: "refactor and document API" → architecture + docs
- **Requires planning** - Needs design/architecture phase
  - Example: "redesign authentication system"
- **Requires research** - Needs investigation/exploration
  - Example: "investigate performance bottleneck"
- **Multi-file changes** - Affects 5+ files
  - Example: "refactor database layer"

### Routing Decision Flow

```
Task Input
    ↓
Complexity Score (0-10)
    ↓
├─ Score 0-3: Simple → Route to commands (current behavior)
├─ Score 4-7: Medium → Delegate to specialized agent
│                      ├─ feature-dev (add/create/implement)
│                      ├─ backend-architect (design/refactor)
│                      ├─ bug-detective (fix/debug/error)
│                      └─ code-quality-reviewer (quality/lint)
└─ Score 8-10: Complex → Delegate to orchestrator-v2
```

### Agent Delegation (Enabled for Score ≥ 4)

When complexity score ≥ 4, `/craft:do` delegates to specialized agents:

| Agent                   | Triggers                      | Max Complexity | Use Case                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| `feature-dev`           | add, create, implement, build | 7              | New features             |
| `backend-architect`     | design, architect, refactor   | 8              | Architecture             |
| `bug-detective`         | fix, debug, error, issue      | 6              | Debugging                |
| `code-quality-reviewer` | quality, lint, improve        | 5              | Code quality             |
| `orchestrator-v2`       | (any)                         | 10             | Multi-step orchestration |

### Example Complexity Scores

| Task                   | Factors                                | Score | Decision                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------- |
| "lint the code"        | None                                   | 0     | → /craft:code:lint        |
| "fix login bug"        | Multi-step                             | 2     | → /craft:code:debug       |
| "add OAuth login"      | Multi-step, Planning                   | 4     | → feature-dev agent       |
| "refactor DB layer"    | Multi-step, Planning, Multi-file       | 6     | → backend-architect agent |
| "prepare v2.0 release" | Multi-step, Cross-category, Multi-file | 8     | → orchestrator-v2 agent   |

Before routing, `/craft:do` checks for existing specs that match the task.

### Spec Check Flow

```bash
# Check for specs in project
find docs/specs -name "SPEC-*.md" 2>/dev/null | while read spec; do
    # Extract topic from filename
    topic=$(basename "$spec" | sed 's/SPEC-//;s/-[0-9].*\.md//')

    # Check if task matches topic
    if [[ "$task" == *"$topic"* ]]; then
        # Found matching spec
        show_spec_prompt "$spec"
    fi
done
```

### Spec Found Prompt

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Found spec for this task. How should we proceed?"
  header: "Spec"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
    - label: "Review spec, then implement"
      description: "Show spec summary first"
    - label: "Implement with spec context"
      description: "Use spec as implementation guide"
    - label: "Skip spec"
      description: "Proceed without spec reference"
    - label: "Create new spec first"
      description: "Current spec may be outdated"
```

### Example: Spec-Aware Execution

```
User: /craft:do implement user authentication

Claude: Found spec: SPEC-auth-system-2025-12-30.md (status: approved)

        [AskUserQuestion: Review/Implement/Skip/New?]

User: Selects "Implement with spec context"

Claude: Loading spec context...
        - User Stories: 1 primary, 2 secondary
        - Acceptance Criteria: 3 items
        - Technical Requirements: OAuth2, JWT tokens
        - Dependencies: auth0 SDK

        Proceeding with implementation...
        Step 1: /craft:arch:plan (using spec requirements)
        Step 2: /craft:code:test-gen (from acceptance criteria)
        ...
```

### No Spec Found

If no matching spec exists and task is a feature:

```
Note: No spec found for "user authentication"
      Consider: /workflow:brainstorm save "user authentication"
      Proceeding with standard routing...
```

## Implementation (NEW in v1.23.0, UPDATED in v2.5.0)

When `/craft:do` is invoked, follow these steps:

### Step 0: Check for --orch Flag (NEW in v2.5.0)

```python
from utils.orch_flag_handler import handle_orch_flag, show_orchestration_preview, spawn_orchestrator

task = args.task
orch_flag = args.orch
mode_flag = args.orch_mode
dry_run = args.dry_run

if orch_flag:
    should_orchestrate, mode = handle_orch_flag(task, orch_flag, mode_flag)

    if dry_run:
        show_orchestration_preview(task, mode)
        return

    spawn_orchestrator(task, mode)
    return

# Otherwise, continue with complexity-based routing...
```

### Step 1: Analyze Task and Calculate Complexity

```
1. Parse task description for keywords and intent
2. Calculate complexity score (0-10):

   score = 0
   if multi-step task (3+ operations):           score += 2
   if cross-category (spans multiple domains):   score += 2
   if requires planning (design/architecture):   score += 2
   if requires research (investigation):          score += 2
   if multi-file changes (5+ files):             score += 2

3. Determine category:
   - Feature (add/create/implement/build)
   - Bug (fix/debug/error/issue)
   - Quality (lint/quality/improve)
   - Documentation (document/update docs/readme)
   - Architecture (design/refactor/restructure)
   - Release (release/deploy/publish)
```

### Step 2: Select Execution Strategy

```
if score < 4:
    # Simple task - use traditional command routing
    route_to_commands(task)

elif score >= 4 and score <= 7:
    # Medium complexity - delegate to specialized agent
    agent = select_agent(task, score)
    delegate_to_agent(agent, task)

else:  # score >= 8
    # Complex task - delegate to orchestrator
    delegate_to_agent("orchestrator-v2", task)
```

### Step 3: Agent Selection Logic

```python
def select_agent(task, score):
    # Check keywords for agent triggers
    keywords = task.lower()

    if score > 7:
        return "orchestrator-v2"  # Complex, multi-step

    if any(word in keywords for word in ["add", "create", "implement", "build"]):
        if score <= 7:
            return "feature-dev"  # Feature development

    if any(word in keywords for word in ["design", "architect", "refactor"]):
        if score <= 8:
            return "backend-architect"  # Architecture

    if any(word in keywords for word in ["fix", "debug", "error", "issue"]):
        if score <= 6:
            return "bug-detective"  # Debugging

    if any(word in keywords for word in ["quality", "lint", "improve", "clean"]):
        if score <= 5:
            return "code-quality-reviewer"  # Code quality

    # Default fallback for medium complexity
    if score >= 4:
        return "feature-dev"  # General purpose

    return None  # Route to commands
```

### Step 4: Agent Delegation (Score ≥ 4)

Use the `Task` tool to delegate to the selected agent:

```
# Example: Delegate to feature-dev agent
Task(
    subagent_type="feature-dev",
    description="Implement OAuth login feature",
    prompt=f"""
    Task: {user_task}
    Complexity: {score}/10 ({complexity_level})

    Please:
    1. Design the architecture
    2. Create implementation plan
    3. Generate test stubs
    4. Identify dependencies

    Provide a structured response with:
    - Architecture overview
    - Implementation phases
    - Test coverage plan
    - Dependencies and tools needed
    """,
    model="sonnet"  # Use appropriate model for complexity
)
```

### Step 5: Result Synthesis

```
1. Receive agent results (automatically synthesized from forked context)
2. Present results to user in structured format:

   ✓ Architecture designed
   ✓ Implementation plan created
   ✓ Test stubs generated
   ✓ Dependencies identified

3. Ask user if they want to proceed with implementation
4. If yes, execute next steps
5. If no, save plan for later
```

### Step 6: Fallback to Command Routing

If agent delegation is not available or fails:

```
1. Log: "Agent delegation unavailable, using command routing"
2. Route to traditional craft commands based on category:

   if category == "feature":
       execute(["/craft:arch:plan", "/craft:code:test-gen", "/craft:git:branch"])
   elif category == "bug":
       execute(["/craft:code:debug", "/craft:test:run"])
   elif category == "quality":
       execute(["/craft:code:lint", "/craft:test:coverage"])
   # ... etc

3. Execute commands sequentially
4. Report results
```

### Implementation Notes

- **Forked Context**: All agent delegations use `context: fork` for isolation
- **Error Handling**: If agent fails, fall back to command routing
- **User Preference**: If user says "no agents", skip delegation
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Show delegation plan without executing

---

## Tips

- Be specific for better routing
- Use domain keywords (auth, api, ui, db)
- Add mode hint if needed: "thoroughly test the api"
- Create specs for complex features: `/workflow:brainstorm save "feature"` (or `s` for short)
- For detailed specs: `/brainstorm d f s "feature"` (deep + feat + save)
- Review specs before implementation: `/spec:review [topic]`
