## How It Works

1. **Check Spec** - Look for existing spec matching task (NEW in v1.1.0)
2. **Analyze** - Parse task description for intent
3. **Route** - Select appropriate craft commands
4. **Execute** - Run commands in optimal order
5. **Report** - Summarize what was done

## Examples

### Feature Development
```bash
/craft:do add user authentication

# Routes to:
# 1. /craft:arch:plan - Design the feature
# 2. /craft:code:test-gen - Generate tests
# 3. /craft:git:branch - Create feature branch
```

### Bug Fixing
```bash
/craft:do fix the login redirect issue

# Routes to:
# 1. /craft:code:debug - Analyze the issue
# 2. /craft:test:run - Run related tests
# 3. /craft:git:sync - Commit fix
```

### Code Quality
```bash
/craft:do improve code quality

# Routes to:
# 1. /craft:code:lint - Check style
# 2. /craft:test:coverage - Check coverage
# 3. /craft:code:refactor - Suggest improvements
```

### Documentation
```bash
/craft:do update documentation

# Routes to:
# 1. /craft:docs:sync - Sync docs with code
# 2. /craft:docs:validate - Check links

```

### Release Preparation
```bash
/craft:do prepare for release

# Routes to:
# 1. /craft:code:deps-audit - Security scan
# 2. /craft:test:run release - Full tests
# 3. /craft:code:lint release - Full lint
# 4. /craft:docs:changelog - Update changelog
# 5. /craft:code:release - Release workflow
```

## Integration

Works with all craft commands and skills:
- Routes to appropriate category commands
- Uses skills for specialized analysis
- Chains commands for complex workflows

## Spec Integration (NEW in v1.1.0)

Before routing, `/craft:do` checks for existing specs that match the task.

### Spec Check Flow

```bash
# Check for specs in project
find docs/specs -name "SPEC-*.md" 2>/dev/null | while read spec; do
    # Extract topic from filename
    topic=$(basename "$spec" | sed 's/SPEC-//;s/-[0-9].*\.md//')

    # Check if task matches topic
    if [[ "$task" == *"$topic"* ]]; then
        # Found matching spec
        show_spec_prompt "$spec"
    fi
done
```

### Spec Found Prompt

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Found spec for this task. How should we proceed?"
  header: "Spec"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
    - label: "Review spec, then implement"
      description: "Show spec summary first"
    - label: "Implement with spec context"
      description: "Use spec as implementation guide"
    - label: "Skip spec"
      description: "Proceed without spec reference"
    - label: "Create new spec first"
      description: "Current spec may be outdated"
```

### Example: Spec-Aware Execution

```
User: /craft:do implement user authentication

Claude: Found spec: SPEC-auth-system-2025-12-30.md (status: approved)

        [AskUserQuestion: Review/Implement/Skip/New?]

User: Selects "Implement with spec context"

Claude: Loading spec context...
        - User Stories: 1 primary, 2 secondary
        - Acceptance Criteria: 3 items
        - Technical Requirements: OAuth2, JWT tokens
        - Dependencies: auth0 SDK

        Proceeding with implementation...
        Step 1: /craft:arch:plan (using spec requirements)
        Step 2: /craft:code:test-gen (from acceptance criteria)
        ...
```

### No Spec Found

If no matching spec exists and task is a feature:

```
Note: No spec found for "user authentication"
      Consider: /workflow:brainstorm save "user authentication"
      Proceeding with standard routing...
```

## Tips

- Be specific for better routing
- Use domain keywords (auth, api, ui, db)
- Add mode hint if needed: "thoroughly test the api"
- Create specs for complex features: `/workflow:brainstorm save "feature"` (or `s` for short)
- For detailed specs: `/brainstorm d f s "feature"` (deep + feat + save)
- Review specs before implementation: `/spec:review [topic]`
