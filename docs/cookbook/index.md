# Cookbook & Examples

Welcome to the Craft Cookbook! This section provides task-focused, step-by-step recipes for accomplishing common goals with Craft.

## What Are Cookbook Recipes?

Each recipe follows a problem-solution format:

- **Problem:** What you're trying to accomplish
- **Solution:** Step-by-step commands with explanations
- **Explanation:** How it works behind the scenes
- **Variations:** Alternative approaches for different scenarios
- **Troubleshooting:** Common issues and fixes
- **Related:** Links to relevant guides and commands

Recipes are categorized by difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) and include time estimates so you can plan your workflow.
