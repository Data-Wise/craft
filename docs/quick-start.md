# Quick Start Guide

Get started with Claude Code plugins in 5 minutes.

---

## Installation (2 minutes)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Data-Wise/claude-plugins.git
cd claude-plugins

# Install a plugin
./scripts/install-plugin.sh workflow

# Restart Claude Code
```

**That's it!** After restart, commands will be available.

---

## First Commands

### Workflow Plugin

```bash
# Enhanced brainstorming
/brainstorm "API design for user authentication"
```

**Output:**
- Multiple design approaches
- Trade-offs for each option
- Recommended next steps
- Auto-delegates to specialized agents

### RForge Orchestrator (Requires RForge MCP)

```bash
# Quick R package analysis
/rforge:quick

# Balanced analysis with recommendations
/rforge:analyze "Update bootstrap algorithm"

# Comprehensive analysis (2-5 minutes)
/rforge:thorough "Prepare for CRAN"
```

### Statistical Research (Requires Research MCP)

```bash
# Search arXiv
/research:arxiv "mediation analysis"

# Generate methods section
/research:manuscript:methods

# Find literature gaps
/research:lit-gap "causal inference"
```

---

## Common Workflows

### 1. Brainstorming a Feature

```bash
# Start with brainstorming
/brainstorm "Add dark mode to settings page"

# Get structured output:
# - Quick wins
# - Medium effort tasks
# - Long-term improvements
# - Recommended first step
```

### 2. R Package Development

```bash
# Quick health check
/rforge:quick

# Before making changes
/rforge:analyze "Add new statistical test"

# Before CRAN submission
/rforge:thorough "Prepare for CRAN release"
```

### 3. Research Writing

```bash
# Find relevant papers
/research:arxiv "bootstrap methods mediation"

# Write methods section
/research:manuscript:methods

# Respond to reviewers
/research:manuscript:reviewer
```

## Understanding Output

### Command Response Structure

Most commands provide:

1. **Summary** - Quick overview of results
2. **Details** - Specific findings or analysis
3. **Recommendations** - Actionable next steps
4. **Options** - What to do next

**Example:**

```
✅ Analysis complete! (10.2 seconds)

🎯 IMPACT: MEDIUM
  • 2 packages affected (mediate, sensitivity)
  • Estimated cascade: 4 hours over 2 days

✅ QUALITY: EXCELLENT
  • Tests: 187/187 passing (94% coverage)
  • CRAN: Clean, no warnings

📋 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
  1. Implement changes (3 hours)
  2. Auto-fix documentation
  3. Run cascade plan

What would you like to do next?
[1] Generate implementation plan
[2] Auto-fix documentation
[3] Show cascade sequence
[4] Something else
```

## Tips & Tricks

### 1. Use Auto-Complete

Type `/` to see available commands:
```bash
/rf<TAB>     # Shows /rforge:* commands
/res<TAB>    # Shows /research:* commands
/bra<TAB>    # Shows /brainstorm
```

### 2. Add Context

Many commands accept optional context:
```bash
/rforge:analyze "Update mediation formula"
/brainstorm "API design" --technical
```

### 3. Follow-Up Questions

After a command completes, you can ask follow-up questions:
```
/rforge:quick

> "Show me the test coverage details"
> "What's the dependency impact?"
> "Generate an implementation plan"
```

### 4. Chain Commands

Use multiple commands for complex workflows:
```bash
# 1. Quick check
/rforge:quick

# 2. If good, detailed analysis
/rforge:analyze "Prepare for release"

# 3. Before release, comprehensive check
/rforge:thorough
```
