## Try It Yourself

Now that you've seen how commands work, try these challenges:

!!! example "Challenge 1: Discovery"
    Run `/craft:hub` and pick 3 commands that sound interesting. Try them!

!!! example "Challenge 2: Automation"
    Run `/craft:do "improve my error handling"` and watch AI route it automatically

!!! example "Challenge 3: Workflow"
    Run `/craft:check` → fix any issues → run again until it passes

!!! example "Challenge 4: Documentation"
    Run `/craft:docs:sync` to see if your docs are stale

!!! example "Challenge 5: Site Creation"
    Run `/craft:site:create --preset adhd-focus --quick` to create a docs site

---

## Common Patterns

### Before Every Commit

```bash
/craft:check                  # Quick validation
# Fix any issues that appear
git add .
git commit -m "message"
```

### After Adding a Feature

```bash
/craft:docs:update            # Update all docs
/craft:check                  # Validate everything
```

### Before a Release

```bash
/craft:check --for release    # Full audit
/craft:docs:changelog         # Generate changelog
# Create release when checks pass
```

### When Stuck

```bash
/craft:help                   # Context-aware suggestions
/craft:do "what you want"     # Let AI figure it out
```
