### Skill Activation

Skills trigger automatically based on keywords:

#### Example

```
User: "How should I design the authentication API?"
→ Activates: api-architect, security-specialist
→ Provides: API design patterns, OAuth2 guidance, security best practices
```

## Agents

Specialized agents can be invoked explicitly or delegated to by the orchestrator.

### 7 Specialized Agents

#### backend-architect

**Purpose:** Server-side design, API architecture, database design

#### Use cases

- Designing RESTful or GraphQL APIs
- Database schema optimization
- Authentication/authorization systems
- Scalable backend architecture

#### Invoke

```bash
# Via orchestrator
/craft:orchestrate "design authentication API" optimize

# Via Task tool (background)
@backend-architect "design user authentication system"
```

#### performance-engineer

**Purpose:** Application performance optimization

#### Use cases

- Identifying bottlenecks
- Load testing strategies
- Caching implementation
- Query optimization

#### Invoke

```bash
/craft:orchestrate "optimize database queries" optimize
```

#### testing-specialist

**Purpose:** Comprehensive testing strategies

#### Use cases

- Test strategy development
- Unit/integration/e2e testing
- Test coverage improvement
- TDD/BDD implementation

#### Invoke

```bash
/craft:orchestrate "improve test coverage" release
```

#### security-specialist

**Purpose:** Security audits and secure coding

#### Use cases

- OWASP vulnerability assessment
- Authentication/authorization review
- Secure coding practices
- Security audit preparation

#### Invoke

```bash
/craft:orchestrate "security audit" release
```

#### devops-engineer

**Purpose:** CI/CD and deployment automation

#### Use cases

- Pipeline setup and optimization
- Docker/Kubernetes configuration
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Deployment strategies

#### Invoke

```bash
/craft:orchestrate "setup CI/CD pipeline" optimize
```

#### tech-lead

**Purpose:** Technical leadership and coordination

#### Use cases

- Architectural decisions
- Technical strategy
- Team coordination
- Technical debt management

#### Invoke

```bash
/craft:orchestrate "plan technical roadmap" release
```

#### code-quality-reviewer

**Purpose:** Code quality standards and best practices

#### Use cases

- Code review automation
- Refactoring guidance
- Design pattern application
- Clean code principles

#### Invoke

```bash
/craft:orchestrate "code review" debug
```

## Orchestrator Integration

The orchestrator intelligently selects and coordinates agents based on task requirements.

### Multi-Agent Coordination

#### Example workflow

```
User: "Prepare application for production release"

Orchestrator analyzes request
→ Pattern: PRODUCTION_RELEASE
→ Mode: release (comprehensive)

Launches agents in parallel:
1. security-specialist    - Security audit
2. performance-engineer   - Performance check
3. testing-specialist     - Full test suite
4. devops-engineer        - Deployment readiness

Waits for all agents to complete (5-10 minutes)

Synthesizes results:
✅ Security: No critical vulnerabilities
⚠️  Performance: 2 slow queries identified
✅ Tests: 245/245 passing, 85% coverage
✅ DevOps: CI/CD pipeline ready

Recommendations:
1. Optimize identified slow queries (priority)
2. Increase test coverage to 90% (recommended)
3. Ready for production deployment
```

### Agent Communication

Agents can communicate and coordinate:

```
security-specialist: "Found potential SQL injection in login endpoint"
→ Notifies backend-architect
→ backend-architect: "Refactoring with parameterized queries"
→ Notifies testing-specialist
→ testing-specialist: "Adding security test cases"
```

## Mode-Aware Behavior

Agents adapt their behavior based on mode:

| Mode | Agent Behavior |
|------|----------------|
| **default** | Quick analysis, high-level recommendations |
| **debug** | Verbose output, detailed traces, step-by-step |
| **optimize** | Parallel execution, focus on performance |
| **release** | Comprehensive audit, production-ready checks |

#### Example

```bash
# Quick check
/craft:orchestrate "check code quality"
→ Agents: [code-quality-reviewer]
→ Time: <10s
→ Output: High-level summary

# Comprehensive audit
/craft:orchestrate "check code quality" release
→ Agents: [code-quality-reviewer, security-specialist, performance-engineer]
→ Time: <5 minutes
→ Output: Detailed report with actionable items
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Skills vs Agents

#### Use Skills (automatic)

- Conversational guidance
- Just-in-time expertise
- No explicit invocation needed

#### Use Agents (explicit)

- Complex multi-step tasks
- Background processing
- Coordinated multi-agent workflows
- Production-ready deliverables

### Combining Skills and Agents

#### Optimal workflow

1. Start conversation (skills activate automatically)
2. Get general guidance from skills
3. When ready to implement, invoke agents via orchestrator
4. Agents execute in parallel with skills providing context

### Agent Selection Tips

- **Single focus:** Use specific agent (`@backend-architect`)
- **Multiple concerns:** Use orchestrator to coordinate agents
- **Quick tasks:** Let orchestrator choose (default mode)
- **Complex projects:** Specify release mode for comprehensive coverage
