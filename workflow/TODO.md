## 🔄 Current Sprint: Planning & RForge Improvements

**Status:** Ready for implementation decisions
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**Goal:** Stabilize v0.1.0 with RForge patterns before expanding features

### This Week (Dec 24-31)
- [x] Create planning documents (.STATUS, TODO.md, IDEAS.md)
- [x] Analyze workflow vs documentation gaps
- [x] Review RForge improvement patterns
- [ ] Decide v0.2.0 scope (Commands vs Testing first?)
- [ ] Test mode system improvements with real usage

## 📋 Implementation Backlog

### Priority 1: RForge Improvements (2-3 weeks)

**Week 1: Mode System** (5 hours)
- [ ] Add time budgets to /brainstorm modes
  - [ ] quick mode: < 60 seconds (MUST)
  - [ ] default mode: < 300 seconds (SHOULD)
  - [ ] thorough mode: < 1800 seconds (MAX)
- [ ] Add format parameter (--format terminal|json|markdown)
- [ ] Implement time budget enforcement
- [ ] Create mode selection guide
- [ ] Update documentation

**Week 2: Testing Infrastructure** (8 hours)
- [ ] Create pytest infrastructure
  - [ ] tests/conftest.py with fixtures
  - [ ] tests/unit/ directory
  - [ ] tests/integration/ directory
  - [ ] tests/performance/ directory
- [ ] Write unit tests (40-60 total)
  - [ ] test_mode_parsing.py (10 tests)
  - [ ] test_brainstorm_modes.py (15 tests)
  - [ ] test_agent_delegation.py (10 tests)
  - [ ] test_skill_activation.py (10 tests)
  - [ ] test_backward_compat.py (5 tests)
- [ ] Add test requirements (pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock)
- [ ] Run all tests (target: < 2s execution)

**Week 3: CI/CD** (6 hours)
- [ ] Create dedicated workflow (.github/workflows/validate-workflow.yml)
- [ ] Add matrix testing (Python 3.9-3.12)
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking job
- [ ] Add documentation validation job
- [ ] Deploy and verify all jobs passing

**Success Criteria:**
- Mode system with time budgets enforced
- 40+ pytest tests (< 2s execution, 100% passing)
- Dedicated CI/CD (5+ jobs passing)
- 3 output formats (terminal, json, markdown)

### Priority 2: v0.2.0 Commands (12-18 hours) - OPTIONAL

**Decision Point:** Implement after RForge improvements OR defer based on user feedback?

#### /analyze Command (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Create commands/analyze.md
- [ ] Implement mode system (quick/default/comprehensive)
- [ ] Architecture diagram generation
- [ ] Technical debt analysis
- [ ] Dependency mapping
- [ ] Write 10-15 tests

#### /review Command (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Create commands/review.md
- [ ] Security vulnerability scan
- [ ] Code quality metrics
- [ ] Best practice validation
- [ ] Write 10-15 tests

#### /optimize Command (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Create commands/optimize.md
- [ ] Performance profiling recommendations
- [ ] Bottleneck identification
- [ ] Optimization suggestions
- [ ] Write 10-15 tests

**Note:** These commands may overlap with existing plugins (code-review, performance-engineer). Validate need with user feedback first.

---

### Priority 3: Documentation Updates (2-3 hours)

- [ ] Create PROJECT-ROADMAP.md (extract from README)
- [ ] Update README with realistic v0.2.0 timeline
- [ ] Add mode selection flowchart diagram
- [ ] Create architecture diagram (Mermaid)
- [ ] Update QUICK-START.md with mode examples
- [ ] Update REFCARD.md with mode syntax
