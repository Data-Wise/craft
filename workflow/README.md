| **default** | < 5m (SHOULD) | Optional | Daily brainstorming needs |
| **thorough** | < 30m (MAX) | 2-4 agents | Architecture decisions, unfamiliar domains |

**Content Modes:**
- **feature** - User value, MVP scope, user stories
- **architecture** - System design, scalability, trade-offs
- **design** - UI/UX, accessibility, user experience
- **backend** - API design, database, auth patterns
- **frontend** - Components, state management, performance
- **devops** - CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure

**📊 Output Formats (NEW in v2.0):**
- **Terminal** (default) - Rich colors, emojis, ADHD-friendly
- **JSON** - Structured output for automation/APIs
- **Markdown** - Documentation-ready format

**Smart Features:**
- Auto-detects mode from conversation context
- Time budget enforcement with completion reports
- Launches 2-4 specialized agents in background (thorough mode)
- Provides immediate ideas while agents work
- Synthesizes agent findings into comprehensive plan
- Saves brainstorms in multiple formats

### 3. Workflow Orchestrator Agent

Manages complex workflows by:
- Analyzing task requirements
- Selecting appropriate specialized agents
- Running multiple agents in parallel (non-blocking)
- Monitoring progress with status updates
- Synthesizing results into unified recommendations

**Example orchestration:**
```
User: "Design user authentication with OAuth"

Orchestrator:
1. Launches 4 agents in parallel:
   - backend-architect (OAuth flow design)
   - security-specialist (security review)
   - ux-ui-designer (login UI design)
   - devops-engineer (secrets management)

2. Provides status updates:
   "✓ Security specialist completed (35s)"
   "✓ DevOps engineer completed (42s)"
   "✓ UX designer completed (58s)"
   "✓ Backend architect completed (1m 24s)"

3. Synthesizes into implementation plan with:
   - Backend setup steps
   - Frontend UI components
   - DevOps secrets configuration
   - Security checklist
   - Next steps (numbered, concrete)

Total time: ~1.5 min (4 agents in parallel, not 4+ min sequential!)
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Auto-Activating Skills (Zero Setup)

Skills activate automatically when you discuss relevant topics:

```
You: "I need to design a REST API for user management"

→ backend-designer skill auto-activates
→ Provides API design patterns (RESTful resources, auth strategies)
→ May delegate to backend-architect agent for deep analysis
```

No explicit invocation needed!

### 2. Brainstorming

**Quick brainstorm** (5 ideas, no delegation):
```
/brainstorm quick feature user notifications
```

**Thorough brainstorm** (comprehensive analysis with agents):
```
/brainstorm thorough multi-tenant SaaS architecture
```

**Auto-detected mode** (analyzes conversation context):
```
You: "I'm thinking about how to handle user authentication"
/brainstorm

→ Detects backend topic
→ Launches backend-architect + security-specialist agents
→ Generates comprehensive auth implementation plan
```

### 3. Design Philosophy

All guidance follows **"Solid Indie" principles:**

✅ **Ship fast** - Pragmatic solutions over perfect architecture
✅ **Proven patterns** - Boring technology that works
✅ **Right-sized** - Complexity matches team size
✅ **Cost-conscious** - Indie developer budget (~$50/month)

❌ **Avoid over-engineering** - No microservices for small teams
❌ **No premature optimization** - Ship functionality first
❌ **No corporate patterns** - Generic repositories, complex abstractions

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: API Design with Auto-Activation

```
You: "I need to add pagination to my API endpoints"

→ backend-designer skill activates
→ Suggests cursor-based vs offset pagination
→ Provides implementation examples
→ Notes trade-offs (cursor = better perf, offset = simpler)
→ Recommends offset for MVP, cursor for scale
```

### Example 2: UI Component Design

```
You: "How should I structure my dashboard components?"

→ frontend-designer skill activates
→ Suggests component composition pattern
→ Recommends card-based layout for scannability
→ Provides accessibility checklist
→ May delegate to ux-ui-designer agent for comprehensive review
```

### Example 3: Deployment Strategy

```
You: "I need to deploy my Next.js app with PostgreSQL"

→ devops-helper skill activates
→ Recommends Vercel (Next.js) + Supabase (PostgreSQL)
→ Estimates cost ($0 for MVP, ~$25/month at scale)
→ Provides CI/CD setup (GitHub Actions + Vercel auto-deploy)
→ Outlines environment variables strategy
```

### Example 4: Comprehensive Feature Brainstorm

```
/brainstorm thorough real-time collaboration feature

Response:
1. Auto-detects architecture + frontend topics
2. Launches 3 agents in parallel:
   - backend-architect (WebSocket vs SSE vs polling)
   - frontend-specialist (state synchronization)
   - performance-engineer (scaling considerations)
3. Provides immediate ideas while agents work
4. After ~2 min, synthesizes comprehensive plan:
   - Technology recommendation (WebSocket via Socket.io)
   - State sync strategy (operational transforms)
   - Scaling approach (Redis pub/sub)
   - Implementation steps (numbered, concrete)
   - Cost estimate (~$15/month for 1K users)
5. Saves to BRAINSTORM-real-time-collaboration-2025-12-23.md

## Configuration

### No Configuration Required!

The plugin works out of the box with sensible defaults.

### Optional: Customize Agent Behavior

Skills automatically delegate to agents when thorough analysis is needed. You can control delegation by:

**In conversation:**
- Use `/brainstorm quick` to skip agent delegation
- Use `/brainstorm thorough` to force deep analysis

**Agents used:**
- backend-architect (from experienced-engineer plugin)
- ux-ui-designer (from experienced-engineer plugin)
- devops-engineer (from experienced-engineer plugin)
- security-specialist (from experienced-engineer plugin)
- performance-engineer (from experienced-engineer plugin)

*Note: These agents must be installed separately (typically included in Claude Code).*

---

## Design Patterns Library

Skills reference proven patterns for common scenarios:

### Backend Patterns
- **RESTful API design** - Resources, HTTP methods, versioning
- **Authentication flows** - JWT vs sessions, OAuth 2.0, API keys
- **Database design** - Normalization, indexing, migrations
- **Caching strategies** - Redis, in-memory, CDN

### Frontend Patterns
- **Component composition** - Container/presentational, compound components
- **State management** - Context, Redux, Zustand (when to use which)
- **Accessibility** - WCAG checklist, keyboard nav, screen readers
- **Performance** - Code splitting, lazy loading, virtualization

### DevOps Patterns
- **CI/CD pipelines** - GitHub Actions, testing automation
- **Deployment platforms** - Vercel, Render, Fly.io (comparison)
- **Infrastructure** - Docker multi-stage builds, container orchestration
- **Cost optimization** - Free tier strategies, scaling thresholds

### ADHD-Friendly Patterns
- **Progressive disclosure** - Hide complexity behind toggles
- **Immediate feedback** - Loading states, success confirmations
- **Visual hierarchy** - Clear focus states, limited colors
- **Cognitive load reduction** - One action per screen, templates

---

## Troubleshooting

### Skills Not Auto-Activating

**Check:**
1. Plugin installed in `~/.claude/plugins/workflow/`
2. Skills directory present: `~/.claude/plugins/workflow/skills/design/`
3. Restart Claude Code

**Test activation:**
```
You: "I need to design a REST API"

Expected: backend-designer skill should activate and provide guidance
```

### Agent Delegation Not Working

**Possible causes:**
1. Missing experienced-engineer plugin (provides specialized agents)
2. Agent timed out (5 min max per agent)
3. Using quick mode (`/brainstorm quick` skips delegation)

**Check agent availability:**
```
# Should list agents: backend-architect, ux-ui-designer, devops-engineer, etc.
ls ~/.claude/plugins/experienced-engineer/agents/
```

### Brainstorm Files Not Saving

**Check:**
1. Write permissions in current directory
2. Fallback location: `~/brainstorms/` should be writable

**Manual save location:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/brainstorms
chmod 755 ~/brainstorms
```
