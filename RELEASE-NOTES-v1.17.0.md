## ✨ Major Features (v1.17.0)

### 1. Workflow Commands Integration (12 commands)

All workflow plugin commands are now available in craft:

#### **Brainstorming & Planning:**

- `/brainstorm [depth] [focus] [action]` - Enhanced brainstorming with smart detection, modes, and agent delegation
  - **Depth modes:** `q|quick`, `d|deep`, `m|max` (2-4 questions, 4-6, 8+ with agents)
  - **Focus areas:** `f|feat`, `a|arch`, `x|ux`, `b|api`, `u|ui`, `o|ops`
  - **Actions:** `save` (auto-save as spec), `exec` (implement immediately)
- `/spec-review <file>` - Interactive spec review with validation and status updates
- `/refine <spec-file>` - Refine and improve existing specifications

#### **Task Management:**

- `/focus [task]` - Enter focus mode for deep work
- `/next` - Get next task recommendation
- `/done [message]` - Mark current task complete
- `/recap` - Generate session summary and progress report
- `/stuck [description]` - Get help when blocked

#### **Background Task Control:**

- `/task-status [task-id]` - Check status of background tasks
- `/task-output <task-id>` - Get output from completed task
- `/task-cancel <task-id>` - Cancel running background task

#### **Workflow Guide:**

- `/adhd-guide` - ADHD-friendly workflow guide and best practices

### 2. Enhanced Developer Experience

**Unified Workflow:**

- All craft development commands work seamlessly with workflow features
- Use `/brainstorm` to design features, then `/craft:do` to implement
- Use `/focus` during development, `/done` to complete tasks

**Example Workflow:**

```bash
# Design phase
/brainstorm d feat save "user authentication"

# Implementation phase
/focus "implement auth"
/craft:do "add JWT authentication"

# Task completion
/done "auth implemented and tested"
/recap
```

### 3. Command Organization

Workflow commands are organized in a new category:

```
craft/commands/
├── workflow/          # NEW (12 commands)
│   ├── brainstorm.md
│   ├── spec-review.md
│   ├── focus.md
│   └── ... (9 more)
├── arch/             # Existing (4 commands)
├── ci/               # Existing (7 commands)
├── code/             # Existing (12 commands)
├── docs/             # Existing (10 commands)
├── git/              # Existing (9 commands)
├── plan/             # Existing (3 commands)

└── test/             # Existing (6 commands)
```
