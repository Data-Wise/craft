## v1.4.0 - Orchestrator v2.1 Enhancement ✅ RELEASED

### Orchestrator v2.1 Features (All Complete)

#### Phase 1: Quick Wins ✅

**1. Real Context Tracking** ✅
- Improved heuristics for context usage estimation
- Watch for Claude Code system warnings about context
- Smarter compression triggers based on exchange count + content size
- Per-agent context budget tracking

**2. Mode Integration** ✅
- Orchestrator respects craft mode system
- `default` mode: 2 agents, 70% compression threshold
- `debug` mode: 1 agent (sequential), verbose output, 90% threshold
- `optimize` mode: 4 agents max, aggressive 60% compression
- `release` mode: 4 agents, full reports, 85% threshold

**Usage:**
```bash
/craft:orchestrate "add auth" optimize    # Fast parallel
/craft:orchestrate "prep release" release # Thorough
```

#### Phase 2: State Persistence ✅

**3. Session State File** ✅
- Persist orchestrator state to `.claude/orchestrator-session.json`
- Enable session recovery after disconnects
- Track completed work, active agents, decisions made

**New Commands:**
```bash
/craft:orchestrate continue      # Resume from saved state
/craft:orchestrate save          # Force state save
/craft:orchestrate history       # Show past sessions
```

#### Phase 3: ADHD Enhancements ✅

**4. Timeline View** ✅
- Visual Gantt-style timeline of agent execution
- ETA countdown with progress bars
- Reduces anxiety about "what's happening"

```
TIME     0    1m    2m    3m    4m

```

### Dogfooding Phase (Manual Testing) ✅ COMPLETE

Live validation tests completed on aiterm project:

- [x] **Live orchestrator test** - Added `ait hello` command via `/craft:orchestrate` default mode
- [x] **Stress test** - 4 parallel agents in `optimize` mode added `ait info` + enhanced `--version`
- [x] **Session persistence test** - Added `ait goodbye` via save/resume workflow

**Results:** All tests passed, features shipped in aiterm v0.3.5

## v1.6.0 - Docs Workflow Commands 🚧 IN PROGRESS

**Theme:** ADHD-friendly documentation workflows

### New Workflow Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/craft:docs:update [full]` | Smart update all docs (or force full update) |
| `/craft:docs:feature [name]` | Comprehensive update after adding a feature |
| `/craft:docs:done [summary]` | End-of-session doc updates |
| `/craft:docs:site [--deploy]` | Website-focused updates |

### What `/craft:docs:update full` Updates

- CLI Help epilogs (new/changed commands)
- `docs/reference/commands.md`
- `docs/REFCARD.md` + domain-specific refcards
- `README.md` (features, badges)
- `CLAUDE.md` (status, quick reference)
- `mkdocs.yml` navigation
- Guide docs (feature-specific)

### What `/craft:docs:feature` Does

After implementing a feature, ONE command updates:
1. Detects new commands, modules, files from commits
2. Updates CLI help epilogs
3. Updates commands reference
4. Updates/creates REFCARD entries
5. Suggests tutorial if complex feature
6. Updates README feature list
7. Updates CLAUDE.md "Just Completed"
8. Updates mkdocs navigation

### Workflow Cheat Sheet

```
AFTER FEATURE:     /craft:docs:feature
END OF SESSION:    /craft:docs:done
BEFORE RELEASE:    /craft:docs:changelog → update full
DEPLOY SITE:       /craft:docs:site --deploy
QUICK UPDATE:      /craft:docs:update
```

**Principle:** Workflow commands CALL individual commands. Individual commands remain for granular control.

## v1.7.0 - Site Commands Redesign 🚧 IN PROGRESS

**Theme:** Complete documentation site management with design standards

**Plan B (Focused):** 9 commands with essential design system

### Command Structure

- **REFCARD.md** - Quick command reference
- **guide-page.md** - Standard guide format

### Navigation Standards

- Max 5-6 top-level sections
