    description: Enhance /craft:docs:check and /craft:docs:update with broken link validation
    problem: "Documentation commands don't validate internal links, leading to broken navigation and 404s"
    target_user: Documentation maintainers, site publishers
    key_insight: "Leverage existing .linkcheck-ignore pattern from PR #13 for known/expected broken links"
    solution: "Integrate markdown-link-check into docs:check and docs:update commands with ignore patterns"
    context: "PR #13 documented ~30 expected broken links in .linkcheck-ignore file"
    phases:
      - "Phase 1: Add link validation to docs:check and docs:update (60 min)"
      - "Phase 2: Parse .linkcheck-ignore file for exceptions (30 min)"
      - "Phase 3: Add mode flags (quick/thorough) (30 min)"
      - "Phase 4: Testing and documentation (30 min)"
    quick_wins:
      - "⚡ Validate all markdown links in docs/ - 30 min"
      - "⚡ Parse .linkcheck-ignore patterns - 20 min"
      - "⚡ Report broken vs expected broken links - 10 min"
    deliverables:
      - "Enhanced /craft:docs:check with --check-links flag"
      - "Enhanced /craft:docs:update with automatic link validation"
      - ".linkcheck-ignore parser utility"
      - "Broken link report with categories (critical, expected, external)"
      - "Integration with CI/CD pre-commit hooks"
      - "Documentation for .linkcheck-ignore format"
    success_metrics:
      - "Catch broken links before deployment (0 broken links in production)"
      - "Reduce link maintenance time (manual checking → automated)"
      - "Clear distinction between critical and expected broken links"
