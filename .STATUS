# Project Structure Cleanup (Jan 7, 2026 - Afternoon)

## 🎯 Cleanup Goals

**Problem Identified:**
- 53 root markdown files (too cluttered)
- 19 session/planning files in root
- 11 MODE-SYSTEM-* files (development history)
- 3 CI/CD documentation files
- Build artifacts polluting git status

**Target Structure:**
- ~15 core root files (72% reduction)
- All sessions archived by year/topic
- Consolidated comprehensive docs
- Self-contained plugin structure
- Enhanced .gitignore to prevent future clutter

## 📋 Cleanup Plan (3 Phases)

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (30 min) - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create archive directory structure
- [x] Archive session files to sessions/2024 and sessions/2025
- [x] Clean build artifacts (.DS_Store, .coverage, caches)
- [x] Update .gitignore with session file patterns
- [x] Commit: "chore: archive session files and clean build artifacts"

**Impact:** 53 → 32 root files (40% reduction)
**Commit:** c448bfc

### Phase 2: Documentation Consolidation (1 hour) - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Consolidate MODE-SYSTEM-* files into docs/MODE-SYSTEM.md
- [x] Consolidate CI/CD files into docs/CICD.md
- [x] Archive originals to sessions/mode-system-development and sessions/cicd-development
- [x] Update mkdocs.yml navigation
- [x] Commit: "docs: consolidate MODE-SYSTEM and CICD documentation"

**Impact:** 32 → 23 root files (28% reduction)
**Commit:** dc4405f

### Phase 3: Plugin Organization (30 min) - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Move workflow-specific files to workflow/docs/archive/
- [x] Move development reports to sessions/2025/
- [x] Create archive directories for all plugins
- [x] Commit: "refactor: move plugin-specific docs to plugin archives"

**Impact:** 23 → 13 root files (43% reduction)
**Commit:** b5223dd
